The [RECOVER initiative](https://recovercovid.org/) seeks to understand, diagnose, prevent, and treat Long COVID and help people who are suffering. 

As part of the RECOVER EHR cohort, I used the National Covid Cohort Collaborative ([N3C](https://covid.cd2h.org/)) database to help identify ways to prevent Long Covid. N3C is a unique resource with electronic health records for over 9 million Covid patients from health systems across the USA.

To draw causal inferences from this observational dataset, I used techniques including [target trial emulation](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.21383), [clone-censor-weight](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa057), and [inverse probability of treatment weighting](https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfab158).
