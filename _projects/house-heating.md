Winter of 2024-25 was really cold. When I started trying to adjust thermostat schedules to save money, I got some counter-intuitive results. This was mostly because I have a heat pump. Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces under most circumstance, but once it gets below freezing, things get wonky.

Is it more efficient to let the house get cold at night? How much would I actually save by forcing my wife to wear a puffy jacket indoors? Can you work around peak energy rates in the morning while staying comfortable? These are the burning questions I set out to answer.
