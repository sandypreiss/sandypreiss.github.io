I'm a data scientist with over 10 years of experience using analytics to inform decisions and advance knowledge.

Currently, I'm a Data Science Manager at [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/)'s [Center for Data Science and AI](https://www.rti.org/solution/rti-center-data-science). I spend about 25% of my time supervising a team of five data scientists, guiding center-level strategy, and developing new business. I spend the rest as an individual contributor, applying machine learning methods to a variety of public health and social science domains.

Technical
------
I consider myself a generalist. I don't specialize in any one domain, data type, or problem space. Instead, my speciality is working with stakeholders and subject matter experts to:

1. **Identify problems:** find pain points or knowledge gaps in current processes that could be solved with machine learning,
1. **Ask the right questions:** to surface constraints and gotchas early, and
1. **Identify solutions:** design and develop machine learning pipelines to solve problems.

To date, most of my [projects](/projects/) have fallen into three broad technical areas:

- **Applied natural language processing,** including a wide range of data sources (social media, survey, scientific); models (LLMs, BERT-based); and problem spaces (information extraction, thematic analysis, Q&A systems).
- **Causal inference with observational data,** with an emphasis on the healthcare domain and EHR data.
- **Microsimulation,** including agent-based and discrete-event models.

I work with open-source languages and tools whenever possible. Most of my work is in Python and PySpark, with a sprinkle of SQL and R.

Depending on the project, I've built products ranging from one-off analyses to Python packages and deployed apps.

Leadership
------
I base my leadership style on three philosophies:

1. **Servant leadership:** I put the success and professional growth of my team first.
2. **Coaching:** I build strong relationships with team members. I ask questions and give feedback to help them grow as individuals.
3. **Sources of influence:** Years ago, a boss and mentor had my team read *Influencer* by Joseph Grenny et al. I'm not usually one for self-help books, but this one stuck with me. (No, it's not about increasing your Instagram engagement.) The core idea is to start from the assumption that most people intrinsically want to do good work. And if that's not happening, try to identify the personal, social, and/or structural barrier(s) at play. 

In addition to people management, I've led many cross-functional project teams, up to 20+ people. I use Agile project management approaches and tools, including GitHub Projects/Issues and Jira.
